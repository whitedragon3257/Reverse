/* 
 [ NOTA IMPORTANTE ]

Este código é apenas uma DEMONSTRAÇÃO de como um ataque de Shell reverso é realizado, o mesmo não possui todas as 
funcionalidades de um ataque real, portanto é possivel que sua maquina o bloqueie antes mesmo de compila-lo.

No entanto, é de suma importancia o entendimento de que este código é para fins EDUCATIVOS, portanto NÃO ME RESPONSABILIZO
por QUAISQUER usos INAPROPRIADOS do mesmo.

// 1 -> digite: msfconsole
// 2 -> digite: use exploit/multi/handler

// O metasploit ira aguardar uma conexao, com isso quando a vitima abrir o reverseHTTPS a conexao sera estabelecida e o acesso sera consedido via msfconsole
